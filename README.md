# Planner

## Overview

This application serves as an online weekly day planner. 

## Usage

This planner is divided into hourly blocks representing typical business hours. For clarity, blocks of time in the past are in grey, the present hour is in red, and future hours are in green (this will update accordingly through the day). The user can write tasks for a particular hour directly into the time block and it will be saved to the page and can be viewed again if the page is refreshed or re-loaded later on. 

## Technologies

This application was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Sources

The starter code for the application was sourced from @Xanthadu on Github.
